# Das Kroko project

This is a mobile app written in Flutter allowing me and my friends to play a
[Crocodile board game](https://add-hobby.ru/crocodil.html) using a randomly generated word corpus
instead of the predefined one printed on the provided paper cards.

The sources are bundled with about ~15k 2-grams (word combinations) in Russian. However, you can
generate your own corpus consisting of adjectives and nouns with my [DasKrokoData project](https://github.com/propush/DasKrokoData).
